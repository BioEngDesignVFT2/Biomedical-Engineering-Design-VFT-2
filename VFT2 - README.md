Our PSIV Group was tasked to look into Compliance for arteries and find out the errors associated with time-averaged wall shear stress. We were tasked to calculate how much this error was. To approach this problem we had to understand the concepts of Computational Fluid Dynamics and how different biological processes alter the properties of blood flow. 

Anis Makesh - I have used the FEAToolbox in MATLAB to simulate how fluid flows through a cylinder assuming rigid walls with zero compliance. I have managed to simulate the flow of blood in luminal direction. I have simulated the flow of blood if Artherosclerosis is present in the blood vessel and I have simulated the blood flow in Arteries and Veins. I am currently working on trying to model arteries with compliance and calculate the error present between these different properties. I intend to do this by inputting a softer material at the edges of the blood vessel to model the compliant properties of arteries. In the GitHub repository I have attached the code and results from current work

Yinan Zhao - I use Matlab code to make a circulation model of Blood Flow in Vessels. I take the non-linear Navier-Stokes equation for conservation of mass and linearize them. My code implement a two step Lax-Wendroff method. The results can tell me how pressure affects area and flow of a blood vessel and it models the compliance of ateries. I also find a tool in Matlab called Graphical User Interface (GUI), this functions have been used to perform the calculation of blood flow properties, If one of the time-dependent blood flow properties is known, then the remaining properties can be calculated. like the velocity profile and wall shear stress. What Iâ€™ll do next, is to redefine or assign some values of blood flow to suit our project. And then measure the wall shear stress in 2 conditions.

Hayyaan Bashir & Liam Brosnan - We both researched into literature through Openstax including 'Anatomy and Physiology' and 'College Physics'. From these texts we were able to obtain equations which allowed us to calculate the blood flow rate in an artery. This was simulated in MATLAB. Through other research papers we were able to get ahold of the parameters for each variable in the equation. We are currently trying to figure out the units for each parameter and how this may affect the number we obtain. One paper states that blood flow rate should be in m^3/sec. However traditionally blood flow rate is in L/min. So this creates a problem with what number we obtain. We have been using the Hagen - Poisueille Equation. We could potentially progress onto Navier-Stokes Equations with the use of a research paper we have found which simplifies things and provides code.
