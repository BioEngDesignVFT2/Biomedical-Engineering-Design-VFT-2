Our PSIV Group was tasked to look into Compliance for arteries and find out the errors associated with time-averaged wall shear stress. We were tasked to calculate how much this error was. To approach this problem we had to understand the concepts of Computational Fluid Dynamics and how different biological processes alter the properties of blood flow. 

Anis Makesh - I have used the FEAToolbox in MATLAB to simulate how fluid flows through a cylinder assuming rigid walls with zero compliance. I have managed to simulate the flow of blood in luminal direction. I have simulated the flow of blood if Artherosclerosis is present in the blood vessel and I have simulated the blood flow in Arteries and Veins. I am currently working on trying to model arteries with compliance and calculate the error present between these different properties. I intend to do this by inputting a softer material at the edges of the blood vessel to model the compliant properties of arteries. In the GitHub repository I have attached the code and results from current work
